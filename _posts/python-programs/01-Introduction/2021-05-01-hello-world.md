## 1. Hello World Program

```python
# This program prints Hello World! on the screen
print("Hello World!")
```

In this program, we have used the built-in `print()` function to print the string `Hello, world!` on our screen.

By the way, a [string](https://mohdirfan.netlify.app/posts/string) is a sequence of characters. In Python, strings are enclosed inside single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes.
