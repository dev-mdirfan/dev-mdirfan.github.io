Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. **Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs** that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. **The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically** without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

## Learning System

### Example 1

![Example-1.png](../../assets/images/posts/machine-learning/Example-1.png)

**What is Machine Learning?** Have you ever shopped online? So while checking for a product, did you noticed when it recommends for a product similar to what you are looking for? or did you noticed “the person bought this product also bought this” combination of products. How are they doing this recommendation? This is machine learning.

### Example 2

![Example 2](../../assets/images/posts/machine-learning/Example-2.png)

Did you ever get a call from any bank or finance company asking you to take a loan or an insurance policy? What do you think, do they call everyone? No, they call only a few selected customers who they think will purchase their product. How do they select? This is target marketing and can be applied using Clustering. This is machine learning.

## Types of Learning

Machine learning is sub-categorized to three types:

1. Supervised Learning – Train Me!
2. Unsupervised Learning – I am self sufficient in learning
3. Reinforcement Learning – My life My rules! (Hit & Trial)
